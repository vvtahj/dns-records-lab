# üåê DNS Configuration & Troubleshooting

> In this lab, I explored how DNS functions within a domain environment by working directly with a Windows Server domain controller and client machine. I gained hands-on experience in creating and managing DNS records, diagnosing resolution issues, and understanding how local caching affects network behavior.

---

## üß∞ Skills & Tools Used
- Windows Server 2022  
- DNS Manager  
- Windows 10 Client  
- `ping`, `ipconfig`, `nslookup`

## üß© Lab Focus Areas

### üî∏ DNS A-Records
Created a custom A-record pointing a hostname to an internal IP address. Verified that name resolution worked properly from the client machine after configuration.

### üî∏ CNAME Records
Set up a CNAME record to alias a hostname to an external domain (e.g., Google). Tested successful resolution using `ping` and `nslookup`.

### üî∏ DNS Caching Behavior
Observed how DNS cache stores outdated records temporarily, leading to incorrect resolution. Learned how to inspect and clear the cache using command-line tools to refresh DNS lookups.

Below are üñºÔ∏è screenshots walking through the process of setting up and testing DNS records in a lab environment using Windows Server DNS Manager and PowerShell.

      When Attempting to ping "mainframe" its going to refer to : 
      (1st) Local DNS Cache 
      (2nd) Local Host File 
      (3.) DNS Server
